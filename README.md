<h2>About:</h2>
<p>iCycle is a novel way to encourage people to integrate recycling into their lives and live in a sustainable matter.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using advanced machine learning algorithms, iCycle enables users to identify whether any item is recyclable with just a single snap of their smartphone camera.</li>

  <li>Using the location services feature available in smartphones, iCycle can show users the nearest recycling centers in their vicinity</li>

  <li>iCycle also uses the latest statistics taken from government agencies and credible organizations to calculate user's carbon footprint and compare it with the average American's.</li>

  <li>Each time a user recycles an item, they receive points. Users are incentivized to be more sustainable by using the points they accumulate to climb the ranks of the leaderboard.</li>

</ul>

<h2>How it works:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>User signs in or registers on the app</li>
  <li>User has the ability to scan an object to retrieve its recyclablity or the user can calculate his carbon footprint and impact on the world and compare it to the average American.</li>
    <li>User scans the object, the app processes the image and predicts various possibilities of what the object might be. If it matches any recyclable material it categorizes the object as a recyclable material.</li>
    </ol>
